    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One variable could cause or depend on the values of another variable.\n",
    "* One variable could be lightly associated with another variable.\n",
    "* Two variables could depend on a third unknown variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful in data analysis and modeling to better understand the relationships between variables. The statistical relationship between two variables is referred to as their correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation could be positive, meaning both variables move in the same direction, or negative, meaning that when one variable’s value increases, the other variables’ values decrease. Correlation can also be neutral or zero, meaning that the variables are unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive Correlation: both variables change in the same direction.\n",
    "* Neutral Correlation: No relationship in the change of the variables.\n",
    "* Negative Correlation: variables change in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of some algorithms can deteriorate if two or more variables are tightly related, called multicollinearity. An example is linear regression, where one of the offending correlated variables should be removed in order to improve the skill of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also be interested in the correlation between input variables with the output variable in order provide insight into which variables may or may not be relevant as input for developing a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the relationship may be known, e.g. it may be linear, or we may have no idea whether a relationship exists between two variables or what structure it may take. Depending what is known about the relationship and the distribution of the variables, different correlation scores can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will look at one score for variables that have a Gaussian distribution and a linear relationship and another that does not assume a distribution and will report on any monotonic (increasing or decreasing) relationship.\n",

Like other correlation coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship. Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.\n",
